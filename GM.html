<h4>Gobi Manchurian</h4>
<body>
<p><em>With Indo-Chinese influences this is just one of the few delicious dishes that is relished across cities in India. A definite on the menu for vegetarians; Gobi Manchurian is coated in a chilli garlic sauce with spring onions. The sauce is rich and thick enough to coat the crispy cauliflower. </em></p>
